# Gene Expression Heatmaps

"Input files" contains csv files with the gene counts (by RNA sequencing) for each zebrafish specimen. There are different counts for the mid-brain region and for the whole brain. Further, the csvs are separated by gene group (for example, genes involved in calcium signaling pathway).

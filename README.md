# Summer_research_2019_nicotine

Starting on May 2019, I spent 8 weeks working with Yale-NUS Asst Professor Ajay Mathuru on his Mechanisms Underlying Behaviour Lab (https://mechunderlyingbehavior.wordpress.com/), located in Biopolis, Singapore. his project aimed at optimising the data analysis of experiments on nicotine addiction, primarily through python scripts and the genomic analysis software Partek Flow.

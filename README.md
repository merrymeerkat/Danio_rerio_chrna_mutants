# Danio_rerio_chrna_mutants

Starting on May 2019, I spent 8 weeks working with Yale-NUS Asst Professor Ajay Mathuru on his Mechanisms Underlying Behaviour Lab (https://mechunderlyingbehavior.wordpress.com/), located in Biopolis, Singapore. In this project we sought to optimise the data analysis of experiments on nicotine addiction, primarily through python scripts and the genomic analysis software Partek Flow.

Feel free to e-mail me at daniela@u.yale-nus.edu.sg if you would like to get more information about the project :)

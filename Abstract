Recent technological developments have greatly impacted how research in the life sciences is interpreted, enabling more efficient and objective analysis of results. This project aimed at optimising the data analysis of experiments on nicotine addiction, primarily through python scripts and the genomic analysis software Partek Flow. We used Partek Flow to investigate DNA-level differences between wild type zebrafish and zebrafish that showed higher nicotine preference due to a mutation on a gene (chrna3) that codes for a nicotine receptor subunit. These differences may provide us with some insight into potential genetic correlates for nicotine addiction. Three hundred and seventy-three genes were found to be differentially expressed in the midbrain of mutants when compared to the same brain region of wild type zebrafish (FDR-adjusted P value < 0.05, fold change > |2|). Circadian rhythm genes were amongst the most differentially expressed, which concurs with existing research on genes correlated with nicotine addiction. However, novel genes were also identified within this group. Knowing which genes are correlated with nicotine addiction may provide potential molecular targets for pharmacological interventions and help public health practitioners optimise resources by creating prevention campaigns targeted at risk groups.
